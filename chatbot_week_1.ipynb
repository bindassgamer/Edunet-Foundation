    "## Introduction to Chatbots:\n",
    "\n",
    "A chatbot is a software application designed to simulate human-like conversations.\n",
    "They are widely used in booking tickets, answering questions, shopping online, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, MakeMyTrip bot, Swiggy Genie.\n",
    "### How Chatbots Work:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Chatbots use rules, artificial intelligence (AI), or both to process user queries and provide responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges in Building Chatbots:\n",
    "\n",
    "Human communication is complex, involving:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Slang, misspellings, and accents.\n",
    "* Subtle nuances like different greetings (\"Hey!\" vs. \"Howdy!\").\n",
    "* Training a chatbot is like teaching it a new language, requiring technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Chatbots:\n",
    "- Scripted Chatbots (Rule-based):\n",
    "Follow predefined rules.\n",
    "Best for straightforward queries.\n",
    "Limited capability for handling complex interactions.\n",
    "- AI-powered Chatbots:\n",
    "Use NLP and machine learning.\n",
    "Offer more human-like and context-aware interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Focus:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intent-based Chatbots:\n",
    "A subset of AI-powered chatbots.\n",
    "Works by identifying the user's intent or purpose behind a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Recognizes \"What's the weather today?\" as a weather inquiry intent.\n",
    "Uses structured datasets to map inputs to intents and provide suitable responses.Can handle a variety of user inputs for each intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Environment Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "Use as the coding environment.\n",
    "Install with:\n",
    "`pip install notebook`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Libraries Required:\n",
    "nltk, sklearn, and streamlit.\n",
    "Install with:\n",
    "`pip install nltk scikit-learn streamlit.`"
